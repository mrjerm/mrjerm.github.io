## About Me

I am a freshman at **Penn State University** double majoring in **Computer Science** and **Statistics**.

I am interested in the combination of **Software Engineering** and **Statistics/Data Science** in **Financial Markets**. My goal is to build robust, event-driven trading systems and analyze market microstructure using quantitative approaches.

Currently, I am researching meta filtration and machine learning optimization in trading models and building my own automated trading system in Python.

## Featured Research

### [Project Kintoun: NQ Futures Strategy](project_kintoun.ipynb)
**Status:** *Completed (Dec 2025)*

An event-driven algorithmic trading strategy designed for the Nasdaq-100 E-Mini Futures (NQ).
This project explores how **Market Microstructure** (Break & Retest) combined with **Volume** and **Regression Analysis** can filter out false breakouts in variable volatility environments.

*   **Technique:** Event-driven simulation (partially vectorized).
*   **Data Handling:** Timezone-aligned, degradation-filtered 1-minute OHLCV data.
*   **Key Metric:** significantly improved expectancy (Profit Factor) and risk-adjusted return (Sharpe) compared to naive ORB strategies.
